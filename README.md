# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm CÃ©sar!
I am currently studying Web Application Development (DAW) at IES Vega de Mijas.
I am focused on building robust and scalable web applications.

## Current Projects

### Real-Time Messaging Application
I am developing a real-time messaging application using WebSockets and RabbitMQ. The application is built with Spring Boot for the backend and JavaScript for the frontend. In the future, I plan to add Spring Security and JWT for authentication.

Check out the repository for this project: [RabbitMq_Test](https://github.com/CGCM070/RabiitMq_Test)


### Bicycle Sales Website
I have created a website for selling bicycles using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project has allowed me to apply the knowledge acquired in DAW and refined through the Origamid course. work in progress
