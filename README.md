# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm CÃ©sar!
I am currently studying Web Application Development (DAW) at IES Vega de Mijas.
I am focused on building robust and scalable web applications.

## Current Projects

### Real-Time Messaging Application
I am developing Nexus, an advanced real-time communication and collaboration platform. The core of the application uses WebSockets for instant messaging and RabbitMQ for reliable message queuing and distribution. The backend is built with Java and Spring Boot, leveraging its robust ecosystem for enterprise-grade applications.

Key features include:

1. Real-time messaging across multiple channels and servers
2. User authentication and authorization (to be implemented with Spring Security and JWT)
3. A comprehensive notes system with CRUD operations, presented as interactive cards
4. Task management capabilities integrated within communication channels
5. User profile management and customization options


The frontend will be developed using Angular, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user interface across device

The application architecture is designed for scalability, with MySQL as the primary database for persistent storage. The project aims to provide a seamless, all-in-one solution for team communication, project management, and collaboration in the digital workspace."
